Discuss the behaviour you expect from these agents. Explain any modifications or additions
you have made. Which subtype of Chartists do you expect to perform best? Why?

Discuss the behaviour you expect from the random traders. How would they trade in the
market compared to the Chartists?

Run the model you created for the period between January 1, 2020 and October 31, 2023.
Vary the parameter n within a range you choose (motivating your choice) and discuss the
changes in the behaviour of the agents.

Discuss your results. How do the different subtypes of Chartists compare? What about
random traders? Did you expect the results you obtained? Why?
